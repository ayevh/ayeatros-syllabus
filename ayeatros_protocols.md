Identification of danger signs of dehydration and management of dehydration along with indication to take the patient to a doctor


Dehydration:  Identification in children younger than 5 years
Identification of risk factors for dehydration1
    children younger than 1 year, particularly those younger than 6 months
    infants who were of low birthweight
    children who have passed more than five diarrhoeal stools in the previous 24 hours
    children who have vomited more than twice in the previous 24 hours
    children who have not been offered or have not been able to tolerate supplementary fluids before presentation
    infants who have stopped breastfeeding during the illness
    children with signs of malnutrition.

Signs/symptoms of dehydration1
During remote or face-to-face assessment ask whether the child:
appears unwell
has altered responsiveness, for example is irritable or lethargic
      (c) has decreased urine output
      (d) has pale or mottled skin
      (e) has cold extremities.

      Use the table to assess clinical severity: 

                 Suspect hypernatraemic dehydration if there are any of the following:
 jittery movements
increased muscle tone
      (c) Hyperreflexia
      (d) Convulsions
      (e) Drowsiness or Coma

(3) Recommendations on laboratory investigations for assessing dehydration1
Do not routinely perform blood biochemical testing.
Measure plasma sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine and glucose concentrations if:
intravenous fluid therapy is required or
there are symptoms and/or signs that suggest hypernatraemia.
Measure venous blood acidâ€“base status and chloride concentration if shock is suspected or confirmed.
