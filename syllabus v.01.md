## Iatros Syllabus

http://nhm.gov.in/communitisation/asha/resources/asha-training-modules.html
Notes:
Iatros training should be ASHA training along with training in telemedicine
Telemedicine technology will be introduced under the aegis of Charing
Iatros need to work under the Iatros Virtual Hopital

https://www.asha.org/academic/teach-tools/syllabus/
Notes:
Structure to create course work modules
Model for evaluation/feedback

Training module will consist of :

## Orientation
Introduction of medical officer / intern doing  rural posting in PHC about telemedicine and about importance of this because till they don’t know the significance of it, they won’t get involved.
Patient Record Documentation: Training on the uploading of patient records and when they are well versed they can be trained to train the local ASHA or Anganwadi workers.
Identification of potential Iatros: preferably ASHA workers / Anganwadi workers for using the network.
HIPAA and OSHA education to trainees and the interns/doctors involved.
Compliance of above can be ensured by providing incentives to ASHA worker, academic credit to interns and CME credits to physicians.
Training module: a blend of online and offline learning programs and short courses consisting of:
Online and App based Training: Clinical scenarios will be provided to trainees in their native language regarding the topics under the Iatros syllabus, which will help us check their thought process, beliefs and various myths so that targeted offline Continuing Medical Education (CME) program can be arranged based on this; learners showing a set degree of proficiency may be provided with online badges in preliminary sessions.
In-Hospital Training : These will consist of common household and on-field emergencies as well as patient-centered scenarios in a hospital by healthcare providers (Physicians, nurses and other members of healthcare team may be considered as per requirement and skill in delivering the training) aided by the Intern doctors doing their rural postings or MOs as they will be the people in regular contact with Iatros. Will involve live patients with clear signs and also for purposes of simulation.
Feedback: maybe used to understand and address various thought processes, knowledge, attitude and practices of trainees regarding the modules and to know what can be done to make them more learner friendly and accessible for the last mile worker.

Topics that will be covered in the interactive sessions will be:

## HEALTH CARE DELIVERY
Identification of danger signs of dehydration and management of dehydration along with indication to take the patient to a doctor.
What to do when patient has a seizure as witness
Early recognition of Myocardial infarction (MI) in a patient presenting with chest pain so that early referral is possible.
Early recognition of Stroke, differentiating stroke from MI and Cardiac arrest, and its initial management
Identifying seizures and early management of seizures by supportive means.
Identification and Early management of patients with breathlessness, asthmatic patients taught how to make correct use of inhalers by explaining its function. 
How to take Blood Pressure (BP) manually.
Management of severe bleeding
First aid and initial management of different types and grades of Burns
Identification and Management of choking in pediatric and adult patients.
Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
How to administer insulin and monitor and report blood glucose levels
Normal labour: knowledge of the process of normal labour and how to conduct normal delievry by maintaining hygienic conditions, where we will have a labour room visit and live demonstration for facilitating learning.
Encouraging Iatros to spread awareness on control of non-communicable diseases like hypertension, Diabetes type 2, metabolic syndrome, etc
Medical officers will be monitoring Iatros training. Offline CME will be followed by a follow up online refresher CME to complete the training and monitoring for  3-6 months to make them a permanent member. 
           Hospital primer----> online training ----> permanent member  (after examination)



PS:
Create a continuum for Iatros to progress from Twisha (Iatros level 0) to Iatros Registered Nurse (Iatros level 5)
For IRN consult nursing syllabi
Medicolegal consult and social scientists’ consult to decide what levels of iatros trianing can be imparted.
Structuring the syllabus based on levels of Iatros training
Separate Chapters for the protocols/systems (?)
Perceived concerns:
Quasi medical person: will need validation by ?Regulatories
Political will and Administrative support
Metric to grade how to decide levels for Iatros training
